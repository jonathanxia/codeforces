# Competitive Programming Library

The cp library whose primary users are jonathanxia, kxia1729, and WyattWismer.

Project list:
* Tree shaker to reduce submission sizes
* Some form of tracking which library functions are used for which online problems. We can have a directory of "tests" where the top indicates a URL of the problem, but we won't expand the file.
* Reorganize the lib/ directory
* Build out more of the lib/geo subpackage
